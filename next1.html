      <h1>Types of digital computers</h1>
      <p>
        The digital computers used today can be grouped into four types. These
        are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#MicroComputers">Micro Computers </a></li>
        <li><a href="#MiniComputers"> MiniComputers</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Mainframe_Computers"> Mainframe Computers </a></li>
        <li><a href="#Super_Computers"> Super Computers</a></li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="MicroComputers">Micro Computers (Personal Computers)</h2>
      <p>
        It is a type of computer used by an individual. This computer uses a
        microprocessor chip called <mark> central Processing Unit </mark> (CPU)
        to process instructions. Examples are:
        <li>laptop</li>
        <li>Mobile phones</li>
        <li>Desktop</li>
        <li>Smart TVs</li>
        <li>Smart Watches</li>
        <li>Tablets</li>
      </p>
      <h3>Uses of Micro Computers</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>It is used for entertainment</li>
        <li>It is used for teaching and learning</li>
        <li>It is used for research</li>
        <li>It helps to communicate</li>
        <li>It is used in hospitals</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Types of Micro Computers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Desktop computers</li>
        <li>Game consoles</li>
        <li>Laptops</li>
        <li>Notebooks</li>
        <li>Palmtop computers</li>
        <li>Tablet computers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="MiniComputers">Mini Computers</h2>
      <p>
        Mini computers are small computers that are used for home and office
        purposes. They are larger than micro computers and are used for gaming,
        education, and scientific research.
      </p>
      <h3>Characteristics of Mini Computers</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It has higher processing power and storage capacity than micro
          computers
        </li>
        <li>
          It has less processing and storage capacity than Mainframe and Super
          computer
        </li>
        <li>It is smaller than Mainframe and Super computers</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="#Mainframe_Computers">Mainframe Computers</h2>

      <p>
        Mainframe computers are capable of handling and processing very large
        amount of data quickly.
      </p>

      <h3>Characteristics of mainframe computers</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>They are used in large institutions such as governmental agencies and banks.</li>
         <li>They are designed to serve millions of users at a time.</li>
         <li>They are very large and expensive.</li>
         <li>They have larger storage and processing power than mini and micro computers.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Super Computers</h2>
      <p>They are the most powerful of all the digital computers</p>

      <h3>Characteristics of super computers</h3>

      <ol>
         <li>They have the largest storage capacity.</li>
         <li>They are mainly used for performing complex computations such as weather forecasting etc.</li>
      </ol>
